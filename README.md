# Squirrel3-SHA-256
SHA-256 algorithm for Squirrel3

### Instructions
sha256-32bit.nut should be used on a 32 bit system (such as a valve game).

sha256.nut should be used on a 64 bit system

### Disclaimer
sha256-32bit.nut does NOT produce a "correct" sha256 hash. Try any hashing program and you'll see it's totally wrong. However, for the purposes of creating hashes in valve games (ie. obfuscating data), it's sufficient despite the hashes not being "correct" since they are at least consistent
